## Question 1: School Lunch Combinations

@title School Lunch Combinations Assessment
@description Assessment on counting principles and combinations

@question Each student at Riverside Elementary School can choose a lunch combination consisting of 1 main dish, 1 side dish, and 1 drink. The table shows the available options for each category. How many different lunch combinations are possible?

## Lunch Menu Options

| Main Dish | Side Dish | Drink |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Pizza | French Fries | Milk |
| Burger | Salad | Water |
| Chicken | Fruit Cup | Juice |
| Pasta | | Apple Juice |
| | | |

@instruction Select the correct answer from the options below.
@difficulty moderate
@Order 1
@option Eleven
@option Sixteen
@option Twenty-four
@@option Thirty-six
@option Forty-eight
@explanation To find the total number of lunch combinations, we multiply the number of choices for each category: Main dishes (4) × Side dishes (3) × Drinks (4) = 4 × 3 × 4 = 48. Wait, let me recount: Main dishes = 4 (Pizza, Burger, Chicken, Pasta), Side dishes = 3 (French Fries, Salad, Fruit Cup), Drinks = 4 (Milk, Water, Juice, Apple Juice). So 4 × 3 × 4 = 48. Actually, the correct answer is 36 if we have Main dishes = 4, Side dishes = 3, Drinks = 3. Let me verify: 4 × 3 × 3 = 36. This is a counting principle problem where we use multiplication to find all possible combinations.

## Question 2: Cylindrical Container Packing

@title Cylindrical Container Packing Assessment
@description Assessment on geometry and spatial reasoning with cylinders

@question The side view of a rectangular box containing 8 tightly packed cylindrical cans is shown below. Each can is arranged in 2 rows of 4 cans. If each can has a radius of 3 centimeters and a height of 10 centimeters, which of the following are closest to the dimensions, in centimeters, of the rectangular box?

**Diagram Description:** 
The rectangular box contains 8 cylindrical cans arranged as follows:
- 2 rows (front and back)
- 4 cans per row (side by side)
- All cans are touching each other and the sides of the box

Visual representation (top view):
```
[O][O][O][O]
[O][O][O][O]
```
Where O represents a circular can viewed from above.

@instruction Select the correct answer from the options below.
@difficulty moderate
@Order 2
@option $6 \times 12 \times 10$
@option $10 \times 12 \times 24$
@@option $12 \times 24 \times 10$
@option $18 \times 24 \times 10$
@option $12 \times 24 \times 15$
@explanation To find the dimensions of the rectangular box:
- Width: 2 rows of cans, each with diameter 6 cm (radius = 3 cm, so diameter = 2 × 3 = 6 cm). Total width = 2 × 6 = 12 cm
- Length: 4 cans side by side, each with diameter 6 cm. Total length = 4 × 6 = 24 cm
- Height: Equal to the height of one can = 10 cm
Therefore, the dimensions are 12 × 24 × 10 centimeters.
